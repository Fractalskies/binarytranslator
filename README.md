# binarytranslator

## Setting up
- Once downloaded, unzip the binarytranslator zip folder, making sure it is where you want it to be.
- Navigate to the folder directory using cd.
- Run the python file mainRun.py.
- From there you will be able to see a menu which will provide further instructions.

## Future update plans
- Decimal to binary option
- Text to binary option
- Binary to text option
- Better GUI
- Possibly host it as it's own website?

## Notes
I mostly just made this to practice, and for fun because I was bored so it may not be perfect, but thank you for checking it out anyways :)
